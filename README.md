# Marble Madness
2D shooter based rougelike game with the objective of collecting crystals laid throughout the map in order to advance to the next levels. Variety of robots are spawned throughout the map to prevent the player from reaching the exit, with objectives of shooting the player or stealing consumable items (ammo, healing kits) that exist throughout the map. Pits/Holes obstrut player movements, but can be removed with the player pushing a marble over it. Faster completion time of reaching the exit results in more points being earned for each level. 


# How It's Made:
I was tasked with completing a skeleton code of the project, where I was responsible for implementing all funtionalities of each class, score tracking, and loading level/map files. I practiced efficient object oriented programming using base and derived classes to avoid defining specific methods for each class, and can group functionalities of the subclasses. Ex:Defined base classes for players, robots, walls, pits, marbles, consumables who shared characteristics, and implemented subclasses for uniqueness. 

Tech used: C++, XQuartz, Xcode
